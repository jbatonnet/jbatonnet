### Hi everyone, I am Julien Batonnet ðŸ‘‹

Passionate about technologies, application performance and actual results, my goal is to help people using what I love personally and professionally. Using my experience and a wide knowledge of technology that I expand continuously, I build targeted and forward-thinking solutions to quickly achieve results.

I strongly believe we have to use the technology to help people and make the world better. I disapprove companies using technology only for their wealth or deliberately restraining their products capabilities.
